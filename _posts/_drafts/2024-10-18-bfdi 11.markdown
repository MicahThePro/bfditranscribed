Golf Ball: What do you think that cloud looks like?

Tennis Ball: I think the cloud looks like a tennis ball.

Golf Ball: Well, I think it looks like a golf ball.

Tennis Ball: Tennis ball.

Golf Ball: Golf ball.

Tennis Ball: Tennis ball!

Golf Ball: Golf ball!

Rocky: Bulleh.

Firey: Oh my oxygen, Rocky has some serious vomiting issues.

Coiny: Yeah, but when he has to barf, he knows exactly where to.

Firey: Grr!

Golf Ball: Guys, why do you slap each other? It’s pointless.

Firey & Coiny: He’s a jerk.

BFDI INTRO

Golf Ball: Hey, what is that speaker machine doing here?

Announcer: I’m here to remind you that your team, Another Name, lost. Let’s go to the Cake at Stake place to see who’ll be eliminated.

Show: Hork hork hork, glorp glorp, Gloop gloop gloop, doot doot, Cake at Stake!

Everyone: *laughter*

Announcer: The two of you with the most votes will leave the team. One will join the Cherries. The other will be eliminated. Golf Ball and Firey, you each have a Win Token. Would you like to use it now?

Firey: Hmm…

Announcer: Remember, if you use it, half of your votes will not count.

Firey: I won’t use it.

Golf Ball: Well, I will.

Announcer: Out of the total thirty-seven votes, Tennis Ball is safe at two votes.

Tennis Ball: Yay! But don’t I also get some cake?

Announcer: A cake was too expensive, so we’ll pretend. Here’s an imaginary slice of cake.

Show: *splat*

Announcer: Firey is safe at three votes...

Coiny: Grr!

Announcer: ...and Coiny is safe at five votes.

Firey: Grr!

Announcer: Golf Ball and Rocky got twelve and fifteen votes, respectively. Even with her Win Token, Golf Ball's still in the top two.

Golf Ball: What!?

Tennis Ball: Uh-oh, I'm left wit
